[projthis](https://ijlyttle.github.io/projthis/) is a new R-package, which offers a framework for analysis-based project workflows. You can use it to:
    (1) manage the dependencies among files in your workflows; projthis provides tools to support a directory structure and a naming convention.
    (2) manage your project's package-dependencies; projthis helps you use a DESCRIPTION file.
    (3) automate the rendering of your workflow using GitHub Actions; projthis provides a template for an Action.

Here’s a couple examples of analysis projects built and automated (run daily) using projthis: [covidStates](https://github.com/ijlyttle/covidStates), and [covidIowa](https://github.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa). I’ll go over the big ideas I try to implement in the package.
