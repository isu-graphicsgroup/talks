The R package `bulletxtrctr` provides many methods for analyzing bullet striations. And sometimes the results of these automated methods need some manual adjustments in order to be used in further analysis. To facilitate this process of manual adjustment and provide more insights into the data, we developed this interactive tool using Shiny. We also utilized Shiny Modules during the development of our app, which enables other developers to collaboratively extend the functionality of this app
