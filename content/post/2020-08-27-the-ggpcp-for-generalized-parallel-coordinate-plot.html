<p>ggpcp is an R package developed for the generalized parallel coordinate plots which are a useful set of graphics for visualizing data with more than 2-dimensions. It is generalized in the sense of combining numeric and categorical variables together while keeping the ability to track each observation. It helps to see some interesting aspects of the “high”-dimensional data.</p>
