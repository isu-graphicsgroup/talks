<p>We were very fortunate to attend rstudio::conf() last month in Austin; this will be a presentation of our highlights. We will each describe three of our favorite talks (narrowing down to three each was the *most* difficult part). We were not the only graphics-group members there, so we will also invite extemporaneous contributions from our colleagues, as they see fit.</p>

 

<p>tl;dr: It was super-useful and inclusive</p>
