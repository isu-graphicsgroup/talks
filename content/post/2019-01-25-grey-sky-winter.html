<p>To kick off graphics group this semester, we will start with colors and some color themes. Gretchen Albrecht is a New Zealand painter famous for her use of color. Ben Marwick and Di Cook initiated an R package “gretchenalbrecht” as a way to collect and disseminate color palettes based on Gretchen Albrecht’s paintings. We will investigate and discuss the package with a graphical twist. We will also discuss an avenue to create color schemes automatically.</p>
