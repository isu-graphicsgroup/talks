<h1>Visual inference in RNA-sequencing data</h1>
<p>In a visual lineup, actual data is plotted among null data, and humans are asked to judge the plot that is different. Creating visual lineups of datasets allows us to assess statistical significance of visual findings, while connecting exploratory data analysis with inferential statistics. We will discuss some of these concepts. I will also present visual lineups for soybean and honeybee RNA-sequencing datasets. This is a work in progress, and so I would be happy to hear any of your advice and input.</p>
<p>Preparation: It may be useful to read the introduction of the following paper on visual lineups <a href="">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2013.808157</a>.</p>
