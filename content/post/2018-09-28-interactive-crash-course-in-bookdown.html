<p>The <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">bookdown</a> package makes creating a book within RStudio shockingly easy. However, if you’re used to writing in LaTeX, there are some humps and bumps that need to be smoothed out before working with bookdown is as easy as it purports to be. In this talk, we will walk through the knowledge bookdown assumes you have before starting, its little idiosyncrasies, how it compares to LaTeX, and how to use it to make a highly customized book (e.g. a thesis <em>nudge nudge, wink wink</em>). Come prepared by: bringing your laptop, which has the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">latest release of RStudio</a>, the bookdown package, a LaTeX distribution, and git installed <code>(install.packages("bookdown"), install.packages('tinytex'); tinytex::install_tinytex())</code>. You should also have a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account. (Not required but VERY helpful. See <a href="happygitwithr.com">happygitwithr.com</a> for help installing/configuring git/github/rstudio for your system.)</p>
