<p>Last weekend, I attended the Chicago R Unconference, a two day “hackathon” style event for R users and developers. In this talk, I’ll discuss the structure and function of an R unconf, and I’ll present my project with Angela Li and many others, the Unconf Toolbox, a Github organization providing structure and guidance so that future organizers have a guide for organizing an unconf.</p>
