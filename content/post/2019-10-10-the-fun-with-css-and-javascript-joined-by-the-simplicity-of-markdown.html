<p>I briefly talked about pagedown at rstudio::conf 2019 (<a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/pagedown-creating-beautiful-pdfs-with-r-markdown-and-css" class="uri">https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/pagedown-creating-beautiful-pdfs-with-r-markdown-and-css</a>) but did not explain the details due to the length of the talk. This time I will talk about it in depth. I will also demonstrate my last R package rolldown for storytelling with R Markdown (<a href="https://github.com/yihui/rolldown" class="uri">https://github.com/yihui/rolldown</a>).</p>
