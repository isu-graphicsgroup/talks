ggplot2 is an excellent package that allows R users to create stunning data visualizations using the grammar of graphics. Over the years, the R community has developed numerous extensions to ggplot2 that extend ggplot2's graphing capabilities and allow for creating advanced data visualizations with much ease. In this talk, I will introduce some of my most frequently used ggplot2 extensions and demonstrate their use cases using walk-through examples.
