<p>While eating jellybeans isnâ€™t as hazardous in the real world as in the Harry Potter universe, it can still be unexpectedly interesting: you <em>think</em> you have a few raspberry flavored beans, but how do you know one of them isnâ€™t actually cinnamon? In an effort to combat this anxiety-inducing problem, we collected several sets of image data. Iâ€™ll talk about how we applied computer vision techniques to isolate the beans and extract useful features from the images (as well as the associated challenges). Iâ€™ll also show the results from the predictive models we developed, which have a classification accuracy of ~92% and significantly improve on my classification accuracy, which is about 10%.
Note: My original plan was to give this talk in person and bring the jelly beans as a snack. While I canâ€™t do a live demo, because my specimens are stranded on campus, you may still find it entertaining to acquire some jellybeans to munch. ðŸ™‚</p>
