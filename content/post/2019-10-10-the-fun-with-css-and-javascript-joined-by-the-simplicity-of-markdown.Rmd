I briefly talked about pagedown at rstudio::conf 2019 (https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/pagedown-creating-beautiful-pdfs-with-r-markdown-and-css) but did not explain the details due to the length of the talk. This time I will talk about it in depth. I will also demonstrate my last R package rolldown for storytelling with R Markdown (https://github.com/yihui/rolldown).  

The slides for the talk can be found [here](https://slides.yihui.name/2019-ISU-pagedown.html#1).
