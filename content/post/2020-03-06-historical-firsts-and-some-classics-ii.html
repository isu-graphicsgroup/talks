<p>In this talk we are going to re-visit some of the historical firsts as well as some of the classical graphics. William Playfair - Scottish engineer and British secret agent gave us a few of those firsts: line charts, barcharts, and also, alas, pie charts. Looking at graphics created at a time when visualizing out-of-the-box was the only way to go, hopefully also allows us to break through our box and inspires us to visualize things a little differently.</p>
