<p>I will talk about visual hypothesis testing using lineups, including how we model the process of choosing a plot from a lineup, different types of lineups, and how we estimate a lineupâ€™s difficulty. There will also be a lot of pictures of puppies!</p>
<p>The slides can be found <a href="http://srvanderplas.github.io/Presentations/GraphicsGroup/20190905-VisualInference/#1">here</a>.</p>
