<p>Parallel and Distributed computing is very helpful for Big Data analysis and cloud computing. Besides, for bootstrap, simulation and machine learning model estimation, this technique is extremely helpful to reduce computation time. In this talk, I will briefly discuss about how parallel and distributed computing works and then demonstrate some R packages (‘parallel’, ‘doRedis’. ‘doParallel’) that can be used to parallelize computation.</p>
