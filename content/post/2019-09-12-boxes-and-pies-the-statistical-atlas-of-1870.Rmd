The Statistical Atlases of 1870 to 1890 are wonderful sources of statistical graphics, created in a time when conventions for statistical graphics were still very much in flux. We will be looking at some examples of visualizations from the 1870s - some of which will look very familiar, discuss the charts from their cognitive perspective, and look into re-designs based on available Census data.

There will be cake - at the point of writing, the baker is not certain about pie versus box shape.
