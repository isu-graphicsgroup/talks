<p>This will presentation be a grab-bag of three topics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A re-enactment of my rstudio::conf() talk “Small Team, Big Value: Using R to Design Visualizations”.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussion on rstudio::conf() itself.</p></li>
<li><p>A preview of what I plan to submit to UseR! (St. Louis), as a lightning talk – the package I worked on at Uncoast Unconf 2019: {steward}, to help you to document datasets. I’d like to see what the group might find useful for this package, as I work on it between now and July. <a href="https://uncoast-unconf.github.io/steward/" class="uri">https://uncoast-unconf.github.io/steward/</a></p></li>
