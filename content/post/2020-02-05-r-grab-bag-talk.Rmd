This will presentation be a grab-bag of three topics:
 
1. A re-enactment of my rstudio::conf() talk “Small Team, Big Value: Using R to Design Visualizations”.

2. Discussion on rstudio::conf() itself.

3. A preview of what I plan to submit to UseR! (St. Louis), as a lightning talk – the package I worked on at Uncoast Unconf 2019: {steward}, to help you to document datasets.  I’d like to see what the group might find useful for this package, as I work on it between now and July.  https://uncoast-unconf.github.io/steward/
