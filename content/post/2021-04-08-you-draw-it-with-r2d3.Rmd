Past studies - Subjective Judgment in Statistical Analysis: An Experimental Study (D.J. Finney; 1951) and Eye Fitting Straight Lines (Mosteller et. al. 1981) - conducted graphics experiments to evaluate human perception of fitting best fit lines by eye through a set of points or a given trend. We bring this experiment into the modern era with r2d3, following a similar process to NYTimes You Draw It pages. In previous research, we conducted a graphical experimental task using lineups and visual inference to evaluate whether our ability to perceptually notice differences in exponentially increasing trends is impacted by the choice of scale. In the You Draw It experimental task, we focus on determining whether there are cognitive disadvantages to log scales by testing an individualâ€™s ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the development process of connecting r2d3 & R Shiny. You will then get a chance to test out your ability to predict exponential data & fit linear trends by eye.
