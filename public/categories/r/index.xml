      <description>In this talk, I will show you how to create a professional academic homepage (or blog) from scratch using the R package ‘blogdown’. I will first introduce some basic concepts of web construction and some essential tools (‘rmarkdown’ and ‘git/github’) that will be used in building websites with ‘blogdown’. Then I will illustrate how to build a website step by step. By the end of the meeting, you are expected to have your own homepage created!</description>
